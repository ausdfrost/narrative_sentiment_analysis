# narrative_sentiment_analysis
A natural language processing (NLP) project for CSNL.

## The data
62 or so diads (pairs of participants) were asked to describe significant past and future and positive and negative experiences alongside their personal ideologies. They were give 5 minutes per description, and did 5 of these respective descriptions. A brain scan was taken while they described these experiences.

## The analysis
The transcriptions are what we will use to train and deploy our ML algorithm. The goal is to successfully and accurately predict various religious sentiments that are in the personal ideology transcripts. This is ✨verymuchso✨ a work-in-progress.
